# PaddleParsers

I wanted to open source some of the work I was doing for a fun project,
currently hosted here: https://paddle-rankings.herokuapp.com/

You can see the parsers I use to get paddle data from an external source.

Lot's of work to do and opportunities to refactor, this is the first step of
doing them.
